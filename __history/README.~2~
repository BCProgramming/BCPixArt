"BCPixArt" is a bukkit plugin designed to help with various tasks related to the creation of pixel art.

Specifically:

- Calculating required resources. using /pixart calc <imageurl or shortname> you can determine how many
of each block you will need to create that image. 

-building that piece of pixel art for you.

An intended goal was to allow players to build using their own resources, but unfortunately for some reason it refuses to take black wool, so for the moment- perhaps indefinitely-
I have disabled  the ability to enabled usage of player resources for building.

-allow stretches, orientations in various manners, and so forth.

These are facilitated in the Mode options as well as the "Flip" parameters.


Commands:

/pixart

main command; used without arguments, will detail available pixart commands.

/pixart mode [coords]

sets the translation mode; "coords" is a coordinate pair, such as XZ, YZ, XY, etc. this denotes how the X and Y
coordinates of the image are translated to 3-D coordinates in the world; the first coordinate listed will be used as the image X coord, while the second will become the Y.
